# TRcontrol

Adaptive traffic signal control simulation for urban intersections.

This project simulates a signalized intersection with:
- Mixed traffic phases
- Pedestrian WALK + CLEAR protection
- Upstream vehicle sensors (100m, 3 intersections ahead)
- Adaptive green time tuning based on traffic pressure

## Structure
- `index.html` : visualization
- `config/`    : intersection definitions (JSON)
- `src/`       : state machine & controller logic
- `docs/`      : design notes

## Demo
This project is deployed using GitHub Pages.
